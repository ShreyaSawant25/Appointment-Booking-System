In 1885 we began testing and certifying grain cargoes before they were put to sea, and in 1888 we pioneered the idea of independent testing laboratories. Then in 1896, the greatest inventor of them all became part of our story. When Thomas Edison released the wonders of electricity and the light bulb he wanted to ensure that his products were checked, tested and safe. He established the Lamp Testing Bureau, later to become the Electrical Testing Laboratories.

Over a century later, we maintain his ETL mark of quality, and continue to establish new standards in quality to protect consumers and our clients’ reputations across the world. Today we are a global force, operating in over 100 countries, offering Total Quality Assurance expertise, delivered consistently with precision, pace and passion, enabling our customers to power ahead safely.</p>
